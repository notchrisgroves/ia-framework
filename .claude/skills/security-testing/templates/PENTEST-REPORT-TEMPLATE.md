## Remediation Roadmap

### Priority 1: Critical & High Severity (Immediate - Within 1 Week)

| Finding ID | Title | Effort | Complexity | Dependencies |
|------------|-------|--------|------------|--------------|
| 2025-12-01-001 | [Critical Finding] | 2 hours | Low | None |
| 2025-12-01-002 | [High Finding] | 1 day | Medium | Fix 001 first |
| 2025-12-01-003 | [High Finding] | 4 hours | Low | None |

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Apply immediate workarounds for all Critical findings
2. Deploy short-term fixes in staging for testing
3. Schedule production deployment with rollback plan

### Priority 2: Medium Severity (Short-Term - Within 1 Month)

| Finding ID | Title | Effort | Complexity | Dependencies |
|------------|-------|--------|------------|--------------|
| 2025-12-01-004 | [Medium Finding] | 2 days | Medium | None |
| 2025-12-01-005 | [Medium Finding] | 1 day | Low | None |

### Priority 3: Low & Informational (Long-Term - Within 3 Months)

| Finding ID | Title | Effort | Complexity | Dependencies |
|------------|-------|--------|------------|--------------|
| 2025-12-01-006 | [Low Finding] | 1 day | Medium | None |
| 2025-12-01-007 | [Info Finding] | 2 hours | Low | None |

### Remediation Timeline

```
Week 1: Critical findings fixed and verified
Week 2-4: High severity findings addressed
Month 2-3: Medium, Low, Info findings resolved
```

### Re-Testing Recommendation

**Verification Testing:**
- After each fix: Verify specific vulnerability remediated
- After all fixes: Focused re-test of previously vulnerable areas
- 30 days post-remediation: Validation scan to confirm no regression

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Calculation Methodology

**Risk = Likelihood × Impact**

**Likelihood Levels:**
- **High:** Easily exploitable with publicly available tools
- **Medium:** Requires specific conditions or knowledge
- **Low:** Difficult to exploit, requires significant resources

**Impact Levels:**
- **Critical:** Complete system compromise, massive data breach
- **High:** Significant data exposure, privilege escalation
- **Medium:** Limited data exposure, service disruption
- **Low:** Minimal impact, information disclosure

### Organizational Risk Profile

**Current State:**
- **Attack Surface:** [Large | Medium | Small]
- **Security Maturity:** [Initial | Developing | Defined | Managed | Optimizing]
- **Threat Exposure:** [High | Medium | Low]

**Risk Factors:**
1. [Factor 1: e.g., Internet-facing admin panels]
2. [Factor 2: e.g., Outdated software versions]
3. [Factor 3: e.g., Insufficient access controls]

**Positive Security Controls:**
1. [Control 1: e.g., MFA enabled for admin accounts]
2. [Control 2: e.g., WAF in place]
3. [Control 3: e.g., Logging and monitoring active]
