## Purpose
This policy establishes a comprehensive framework for evaluating, selecting, contracting, and monitoring third-party vendors and partners to ensure the security of {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}'s information assets and systems. The policy provides clear guidelines and procedures for assessing the cybersecurity posture of third parties, managing vendor relationships, and enforcing contractual obligations related to security controls and data protection. By implementing effective third-party risk management practices, this policy seeks to mitigate potential risks posed by third-party relationships, safeguard organizational systems and data from unauthorized access and breaches, and protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information. Through comprehensive due diligence processes, regular monitoring, and ongoing communication, the organization establishes and maintains a trusted ecosystem of third-party providers that align with security standards, regulatory requirements, and overall risk tolerance.

This includes cloud service providers, software vendors, professional services firms, outsourcing partners, and any other external entities that support business operations. The policy establishes requirements for cybersecurity due diligence, contractual security obligations, ongoing monitoring, and incident management for all third-party relationships regardless of the size, duration, or scope of the engagement.
