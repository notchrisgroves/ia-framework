## Purpose
This policy establishes a comprehensive framework for protecting the physical assets, facilities, and infrastructure that house {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}'s critical systems, data, and networks. The policy provides clear guidelines and procedures for implementing robust physical security measures including access controls, surveillance systems, environmental controls, and incident response protocols to mitigate risks of unauthorized access, theft, damage, or disruption to physical assets. By implementing effective physical security practices, this policy seeks to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information assets, minimize the potential impact of physical security incidents, and ensure continuous operation of systems and services. Through integration of physical and cybersecurity controls, the organization creates a secure and resilient environment that protects against both digital and physical threats.

## Scope
This policy applies to all {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} employees, contractors, consultants, temporary workers, visitors, and stakeholders accessing organizational physical premises, facilities, and assets. The policy encompasses implementing and maintaining measures to protect physical infrastructure and assets from unauthorized access, theft, damage, tampering, and environmental threats. This includes building access controls, video surveillance, visitor management, secure storage, disposal of sensitive materials, server rooms, data centers, and other critical physical locations. The policy covers physical security assessments, incident reporting, response procedures, and integration with overall security and business continuity programs across all organizational facilities and locations.
