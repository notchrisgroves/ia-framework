## Purpose
This policy establishes a structured and systematic approach for collecting, monitoring, analyzing, and managing log data generated by {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}'s systems, applications, and network infrastructure. The policy provides clear guidelines and procedures for collecting, retaining, protecting, and analyzing logs to support effective cybersecurity incident detection, response, and forensic investigations. By implementing robust log management practices, this policy seeks to enhance visibility into security events, identify anomalous activities, and mitigate potential threats to organizational systems and data. Through centralized logging, appropriate retention periods, and comprehensive log review processes, the organization maintains the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of log data while enabling timely incident response and ensuring compliance with applicable regulations and industry standards.

## Scope
This policy applies to all {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} employees, contractors, consultants, temporary workers, and third-party service providers involved in system administration, security monitoring, or log management activities. The policy encompasses collecting, storing, analyzing, and retaining log data generated by all organizational systems, applications, network devices, security tools, and cloud services. This policy covers all log types including security events, access logs, audit trails, system logs, application logs, and network device logs across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid environments. It establishes requirements for log generation, aggregation, centralized management, analysis, retention, and disposal across all technology platforms and business functions.
