## Purpose
This policy establishes a comprehensive framework for identifying, tracking, and managing software assets within {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}, ensuring their security, compliance, and effective lifecycle management. The policy provides clear guidelines and procedures for discovering, cataloging, and maintaining an accurate inventory of software applications and systems across the organizational network. By implementing effective software inventory and discovery practices, this policy seeks to enhance visibility into the software landscape, improve license compliance, identify and remediate vulnerabilities, and reduce risks of unauthorized or unsupported software deployments. Through regular software audits, vulnerability assessments, and patch management, the organization mitigates potential security risks associated with unapproved or outdated software, protects against software-related vulnerabilities, and maintains the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of systems and data.

## Scope
This policy applies to all {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} employees, contractors, consultants, temporary workers, and third-party service providers involved in software procurement, installation, management, or administration. The policy encompasses systematically identifying, tracking, and managing all software applications, licenses, and systems utilized within organizational infrastructure. This policy covers commercial and custom-developed software including operating systems, productivity tools, security applications, business applications, and specialized software across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid environments. It establishes requirements for software inventories, license management, version control, security assessments, and lifecycle management across all technology platforms and business functions.
