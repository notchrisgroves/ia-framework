## Purpose
This policy establishes a systematic approach for identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and remediating security vulnerabilities across {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}'s technology infrastructure. The policy aims to reduce cybersecurity risks by maintaining an effective vulnerability management program that proactively identifies security weaknesses, prioritizes remediation efforts based on risk assessment, and ensures timely implementation of security patches and mitigations. This comprehensive approach supports regulatory compliance, protects organizational assets, and maintains the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information systems and data.

## Scope
This policy applies to all {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} employees, contractors, and third-party service providers responsible for managing technology infrastructure and security. Coverage includes all information systems, network devices, endpoints, applications, cloud services, and embedded systems within the organizational environment. The policy governs vulnerability assessment activities, patch management processes, remediation procedures, and reporting requirements across all technology platforms regardless of ownership, location, or operational status.

- Threat likelihood evaluation based on current threat landscape and exploit availability

**3.2 Risk-Based Remediation Timelines**
- **Critical Vulnerabilities** (CVSS 9.0-10.0): 72 hours for emergency patching
- **High Vulnerabilities** (CVSS 7.0-8.9): 7 days for standard patching cycle
- **Medium Vulnerabilities** (CVSS 4.0-6.9): 30 days for scheduled maintenance
- **Low Vulnerabilities** (CVSS 0.1-3.9): 90 days or next major update cycle

**3.3 Exception and Compensating Controls**
- Formal exception process for vulnerabilities that cannot be immediately remediated
- Risk acceptance documentation requiring appropriate management approval
- Compensating security controls implementation and effectiveness validation
- Regular review of exceptions with automatic expiration and renewal requirements

### 4. Remediation and Patch Management
