## Purpose
This standard establishes comprehensive guidelines for the secure disposal, recycling, and destruction of technology equipment and components owned by {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}. The standard ensures that all organizational data is completely and securely removed from equipment before disposal, prevents unauthorized access to sensitive information, and maintains compliance with environmental regulations and data protection requirements. By implementing proper equipment disposal procedures, this standard protects against data breaches, ensures regulatory compliance, promotes environmental responsibility, and maintains organizational reputation while supporting asset lifecycle management and cost optimization initiatives.

## Scope
This standard applies to all {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} employees, contractors, consultants, temporary workers, and third-party service providers involved in technology equipment management, disposal, or destruction activities. The policy covers all computer and technology equipment or peripheral devices that are no longer needed within organizational operations including personal computers, servers, hard drives, laptops, mainframes, smartphones, handheld computers, tablets, peripherals, printers, scanners, storage devices, backup tapes, network equipment, and printed materials containing sensitive information. This standard governs equipment disposal across all organizational locations and applies to both owned and leased equipment regardless of age, condition, or operational status.
