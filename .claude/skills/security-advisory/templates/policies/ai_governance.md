## Purpose
This standard establishes comprehensive guidelines for the ethical, compliant, and secure use of artificial intelligence technologies within {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}. The standard ensures compliance with applicable laws and regulations while maximizing business value and minimizing risks associated with AI implementation. This governance framework promotes responsible AI adoption that aligns with organizational values, protects stakeholder interests, and maintains competitive advantage through innovation balanced with appropriate risk management.

## Scope
This standard applies to all {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} directors, officers, employees, contractors, consultants, and third-party service providers involved in AI technology evaluation, implementation, or operation. Coverage includes all forms of artificial intelligence used for business operations, decision-making, product development, and service delivery. The standard governs AI systems embedded in existing applications, standalone AI platforms, and AI-enabled business processes across all organizational functions and geographic locations.

## Definitions

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Machine learning technology, software, automation, and algorithms that perform tasks and make decisions or predictions based on data analysis and programmed instructions.

**AI Governance Committee**: Internal {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} committee responsible for reviewing, approving, and overseeing AI technology implementations across the organization.

**AI System**: Software developed using machine learning techniques that generates outputs such as content, predictions, recommendations, or decisions that influence operational environments.

**Closed AI System**: AI system where user input data is isolated and used only for that specific user's model training, providing enhanced data security and privacy protection.

**Open AI System**: AI system where input from all users contributes to shared model training, potentially exposing user data to other system users.

**Embedded AI Tools**: AI capabilities integrated into existing approved software applications that require no additional governance approval for standard business use.

**High-Risk AI System**: AI applications that pose significant risks to individual rights, safety, or organizational operations as defined by regulatory frameworks and internal risk assessments.

**Sensitive Information**: Data requiring special protection including personal information, confidential business data, regulated information, and any data whose disclosure could harm individuals or the organization.
