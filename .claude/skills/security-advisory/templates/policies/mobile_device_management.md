## Purpose
This policy establishes a comprehensive framework for the secure and responsible use of mobile devices within {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}, including smartphones, tablets, and other portable computing devices. The policy aims to protect sensitive data, maintain the integrity of organizational systems, and mitigate risks associated with mobile device usage while enabling productive business operations. By implementing effective controls and practices, this policy defines acceptable use guidelines, enforces device security configurations, and ensures data protection measures including encryption and remote management capabilities. Through strong authentication mechanisms, regular security updates, and comprehensive user training, the organization minimizes risks of unauthorized access, data breaches, and malware infections while maintaining compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements.

## Scope
This policy applies to all {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} employees, contractors, consultants, temporary workers, and third-party users who use mobile devices for business purposes. The policy encompasses the secure and responsible use of mobile devices in work-related activities, including smartphones, tablets, laptops, wearable devices, and other portable computing equipment. This policy covers both organization-owned devices and personal devices used for business purposes (BYOD). It establishes guidelines for device configuration, data encryption, authentication mechanisms, application management, and network access to protect sensitive information and prevent unauthorized access. The policy defines procedures for mobile device registration, monitoring, security control enforcement, and incident response across all mobile device usage scenarios.
