### Step 4: Build Weekly Schedule

### Step 5: Detail Each Workout

**Workout Structure:**

```markdown
## Day 1: Full Body A

### Warm-Up (5 minutes)
| Exercise | Duration | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Jumping Jacks | 30s | Light intensity |
| Arm Circles | 30s | Forward + backward |
| Leg Swings | 30s each | Front-to-back |
| Bodyweight Squats | 10 reps | Slow and controlled |
| Inchworms | 5 reps | Full range of motion |

### Main Workout (20-25 minutes)

| Exercise | Sets | Reps | Rest | Tempo | RPE |
|----------|------|------|------|-------|-----|
| Goblet Squat | 3 | 10-12 | 60s | 2-1-2 | 7 |
| Push-ups | 3 | 8-12 | 60s | 2-1-1 | 7 |

```

### Step 6: Create Exercise Library

**For each exercise include:**

```markdown
## Push-Up

**Target Muscles:** Chest, shoulders, triceps, core

**Setup:**
1. Hands shoulder-width apart, fingers forward
2. Body in straight line from head to heels
3. Core engaged, glutes tight

**Execution:**
1. Lower chest toward floor, elbows at 45°
2. Descend until chest nearly touches ground
3. Push back up to starting position
4. Maintain rigid torso throughout

**Common Mistakes:**
- Hips sagging (engage core more)
- Elbows flaring to 90° (keep closer to body)
- Partial range of motion (go deeper)

**Progressions:**
- Easier: Incline push-up, knee push-up
- Harder: Decline push-up, diamond push-up, archer push-up
