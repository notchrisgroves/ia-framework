# Strengths Development Workflow

**CliftonStrengths coaching with brutally honest assessment**

---

## Overview

Complete CliftonStrengths coaching workflow focused on theme interactions and blindspot identification.

**Output:** `output/career/strengths-analysis/{YYYY-MM-DD}/`

**Deliverables:**
1. `strengths-analysis.md` - Complete theme breakdown and pattern analysis
2. `blindspots-identified.md` - Brutally honest limitations assessment
3. `development-plan.md` - Actionable recommendations

**Auto-Resource Detection:**
- CliftonStrengths: `input/career/cliftonstrengths-all34.pdf`

**Time:** 15-20 minutes

---

## Core Principles

1. **Focus on Strengths** - Build what's strong, not fix what's wrong
2. **Theme Interactions** - How strengths work together (and against each other)
3. **Blindspot Identification** - Unintended consequences of dominant themes
4. **Brutal Honesty** - Direct feedback, no sugarcoating

---

## The Four Domains

### EXECUTING (9 themes) - Get things done
Achiever, Arranger, Belief, Consistency, Deliberative, Discipline, Focus, Responsibility, Restorative

### INFLUENCING (8 themes) - Lead and persuade
**Statistically RAREST domain**
Activator, Command, Communication, Competition, Maximizer, Self-Assurance, Significance, Woo

### RELATIONSHIP BUILDING (9 themes) - Connect and unite
Adaptability, Developer, Connectedness, Empathy, Harmony, Includer, Individualization, Positivity, Relator

### STRATEGIC THINKING (8 themes) - Analyze and plan
Analytical, Context, Futuristic, Ideation, Input, Intellection, Learner, Strategic

---

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Parse Strengths Data

**Extract from CliftonStrengths PDF:**

1. **Top 5 Themes:**
   - Theme name and position (#1-5)
   - Domain for each theme
   - Order matters significantly (#1 ≠ #5)

2. **Full 34 Themes (if available):**
   - All 34 themes ranked
   - Identify Bottom 5 (critical for blindspots)
   - Domain distribution across all 34

3. **Domain Distribution:**
   - Count themes in each domain
   - Identify dominant domain(s)
   - Note missing or underrepresented domains

---

### Phase 2: Analyze Dominant Pattern

**Focus on #1 + #2 Theme Interaction**

The top two themes create a unique behavioral pattern.

**Analysis Questions:**
- How do these two themes amplify each other?
- What unique behavior does this combination create?
- What's the "signature move" when they work together?
- Career implications?

**Example:**
```
Analytical (#1) + Input (#2) = Insatiable research machine
- Collect massive data (Input) and analyze patterns (Analytical)
- Signature: Turn chaos into insights through systematic analysis
- Career fit: Threat intelligence, security research, data analysis
- Warning: Analysis paralysis (too much data, not enough action)
```

---

### Phase 3: Identify Tensions

**Look for contradictions and conflicts:**

1. **Contradicting Themes:**
   - Discipline (structure) vs. Ideation (chaos/creativity)
   - Deliberative (slow, careful) vs. Activator (fast, action-oriented)

2. **Overuse Patterns:**
   - Achiever working to exhaustion
   - Maximizer perfectionism causing delays
   - Command intimidating team members

3. **Missing Domains:**
   - 0 Influencing themes = leadership challenges
   - 0 Relationship themes = collaboration difficulties
   - 0 Executing themes = follow-through struggles
   - 0 Strategic Thinking = planning gaps

---

### Phase 4: Blindspot Analysis

**Most Important Part - Brutally Honest Assessment**

#### Bottom 5 Themes (if Full 34 available)
- These are natural weaknesses
- You CAN'T develop these effectively (Gallup research)
- Strategy: Partner with someone strong here

**Blindspot Categories:**

1. **Domain Gaps:**
   - Missing domains = predictable struggles
   - Zero themes in a domain = significant blindspot

2. **Overuse/Misuse Patterns:**
   | Theme | Overuse Risk |
   |-------|--------------|
   | Achiever | Workaholism, burnout, "never enough" |
   | Maximizer | Perfectionism, paralysis |
   | Command | Intimidating, bulldozing |
   | Empathy | Emotional exhaustion, boundary issues |
   | Analytical | Analysis paralysis, overthinking |

3. **Unintended Consequences:**
   - How strengths negatively impact others
   - What you don't see because of dominant themes
   - Situations where strengths become liabilities

---

### Phase 5: Development Recommendations

**Use "Name it, Claim it, Aim it" Framework**

#### Name It
- Identify specific strengths and interactions
- Recognize unique patterns created
- Understand situational triggers

#### Claim It
- Accept these as natural patterns
- Stop fighting your nature
- Embrace what you're NOT good at
- Find partners who complement weaknesses

#### Aim It
1. **Role/Environment Fit:**
   - What roles leverage dominant themes?
   - What environments bring out your best?
   - What situations should you avoid?

2. **Team Complementary:**
   - What themes do you need on your team?
   - Who complements your blindspots?
   - What roles should you delegate?

3. **Development Actions:**
   - Specific, actionable recommendations
   - Focus on amplifying strengths, not fixing weaknesses
   - Based on theme combinations (not generic advice)
